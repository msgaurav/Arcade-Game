# Arcade Game Project

## How to run this Application?
* Clone or download this repository to your local computer.
* If downloaded, unzip and open index.html file in a browser.

### How the Game Works?
* The game board consists of six rows and five columns which have different ground patterns.
* It has one Player and four Enemies. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

### Instructions
* The player can move LEFT, UP, RIGHT and DOWN by using arrow keys(:point_left:, :point_up:, :point_right:, :point_down:).
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the tiles block portion of the game board.
* Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting position.
* Once the player reaches the water level which is the top of the game board, the player won and the game resets.

#### Notes
* The starter project provided by Udacity has some HTML, CSS and JS files to start this Game clone project.
